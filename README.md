# UnoDrive

_This project is part of an experiment to convert native applications to PWAs._

A PWA version of the OneDrive application
from [Getting Started with the Uno Platform and WinUI 3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/getting-started-with/9781484282489/).

## Getting Started

1. Install the latest version of [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/).
2. Enable solution wide analysis.
3. Enable code cleanup on file save.

**Run the Application**

1. Run the project.
## Clean code

To keep things consistent:

1. Code styles are [enforced on build](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/project-sdk/msbuild-props#enforcecodestyleinbuild) and the analysis level is set to Latest Recommended.
2. [Nullable Reference Types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/nullable-references) are enabled.
3. Build warnings are treated as errors.
4. Changes should not be committed with unresolved compiler Errors, Warning or Messages.
5. Global usings are used to reduce common using statements in multiple files.
6. ReSharper settings in JetBrains Rider should be applied automatically on C# files.

## User Experience

- Since we will be using MudBlazor, the application will follow **[Material Design](https://material.io/develop/web)** for the web guidelines.
- Custom application styling is in place to make the Material Design feel more platform native.  
Including native fonts, native icons, a denser application bar, rounded navigation meni and buttons do not use all capital letters.

## Architecture

The application is based on [Blazor Web Assembly](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor).

### Components
The application follows a typical organization of components for a Blazor app.
- Common Blazor components are located in a Components namespace.
- Components used for the main layout of the application are in the Layout namespace.
- Blazor components that render as pages are in the Pages namespace.

### Providers
- MudBlazor exposes global functionality through Provider components.
When the application implements and / or overrides provider components they are in the Providers namespace.
- A custom provider for application state is used to initialize the service.

### Services
- JavaScript methods are combined into a single app.js file with a AppJs class to invoke them.
- Application State is stored in memory with an event to notify components when it has changed.

## Reference

These references are presented in a logical order for review from start to finish for gathering a deeper understanding of the code base. There is an assumption that you are already familiar with C# and ASP.NET Core.
